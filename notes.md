1.2
- copy-file CAN be destructive if overwriting existing files (maybe add warning if file exists?)
- use verify file to check if a file exists before the copy-file warning/execution

1.3
- that web ui for db looking panel (adminer?) ONLY for local setups (maybe staging?)
- env validation to make sure it has values (maybe generator with prompts for it?)
